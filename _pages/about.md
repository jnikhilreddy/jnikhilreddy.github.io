I am Nikhil, a final year joint Ph.D. candidate in data science at the University of Queensland and IIT Delhi. I am excited to apply for the post-doctoral research fellow position at your esteemed Queensland University of Technology (QUT). My Ph.D. research focuses on improving Out-of-domain Generalization for dense prediction tasks such as urban-scene semantic segmentation, a subdomain in the field of Computer Vision.
