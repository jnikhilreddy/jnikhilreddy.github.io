I'm a Software Engineer at [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/), working on their [open-source data engine](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB). Previously, I was a Fifth Year Research Master's student in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/). My academic interests are database management systems and computer science education.

I completed my B.Sc. at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, majoring in computer science with a concentration in computer systems.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to [Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/abigale_kim/status/1645590351166722050) and fiber crafting. Feel free to reach out jnikhilreddy[at]gmail[dot]com. I'm happy to chat and connect!
